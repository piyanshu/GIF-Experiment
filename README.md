# Giphy-API-Experimentation

A single page application that duplicates the basic search functionality of Giphy by using their API. This is a demo page by Cayla Savitzky, which utilises AJAX but no framework

This project was made without using Jquery. Instead AJAX requests are handled purely through Javascript, and the JSON file that is returned is navigated through RegEx.

The idea for this project came from this article: https://medium.com/@GarrettLevine/5-projects-to-complete-when-starting-to-learn-front-end-web-development-48e8a1ce3178
